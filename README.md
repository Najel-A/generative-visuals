### Generative Visuals

Our goal project is to take a user's music input file and create a generative AI that forms patterns that matches the song's frequency, tempo, and mood. Our inspiration comes from Electronic Dance Music shows and festivals as the production of shows creates laser visuals that matches the music's drops immersing the experience of the audience.
